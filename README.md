# Password Generator

Online app that generates a password based off of a few user-given parameters. 
Developed as an exercise in CSS beyond what I was used to at the time, focusing 
on advanced Tailwind concepts and responsiveness overall. Updated every so often 
in my off time with better practices, refactoring and general improvements 
from what I learned after I completed this project.
